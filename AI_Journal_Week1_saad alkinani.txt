AI_Journal — Week 1

What I did
- Set up my repo and the AI_Journal file.
- Downloaded and worked through INST326_Week1_Exercises.ipynb.
- Ran each cell and kept the code simple.

How I used AI 
- Quick reminder on f-strings (printing money with {:.2f}).
- Why input() returns a string and how to convert with int().
- Double-check that .strip().lower() is good for case‑insensitive compares.
Total time with AI: ~10 minutes.

What I learned
- f-strings are the easiest for formatting; width like {title:30} lines things up.
- .strip() before comparing strings helps; .lower() avoids case mistakes.
- len() and type() are handy to see what I’m working with.

Integrity note
- I wrote the final code myself. AI was only for quick explanations and one tiny bug fix idea.
